  "aboutpara": "Hikendog is a web3 application that combines hiking and GameFi, aiming to provide users with both the joy of hiking and the potential for earning rewards. By integrating gaming elements into the hiking experience, Hikendog offers users an immersive and rewarding journey. HikenDog was born to change the current landscape where many Move2Earn projects lack entertainment value and have high barriers for web2 users to join. We have incorporated the exploratory nature of Pok√©mon Go and the entertainment value of the Doge ecosystem. Additionally, we have integrated numerous gaming-oriented NFTs. Our concept is centered around 'Hiking to earn,' where the key emphasis lies in the idea of hiking for fun and subsequently earning rewards.",
